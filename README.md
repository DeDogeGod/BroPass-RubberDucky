- Plug and go and see their saved browser passwords in your usb rubber ducky. 
  This can be also done with 2 usb's if you dont want the usb pop up disturbing the process. If the delays arnt right for you I will make a bash bunny script with the rubber ducky text files also in their. The default inject.bin was optomized for speed on a lenova yoga 2 64 bit slowed.
